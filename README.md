# Missing Error Handling in Express.js Route Handler

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: insufficient error handling.  The `bug.js` file shows a route that attempts to fetch a user by ID. However, it lacks proper handling for cases where the ID is invalid or the user doesn't exist. This leads to a generic and unhelpful 404 error.

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with improved error handling, providing more informative error messages and appropriate HTTP status codes.
